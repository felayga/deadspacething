Dead Space configuration thing

The game seems to not want to indicate what you can and cannot bind mouse buttons to.
But it's right in the configuration file!
Turns out the list is pretty limited.
Forcing a key to accept mouse input by manual config file editing doesn't work: the bindings are simply ignored.

Despite that, this tool made configuration a fraction less annoying for me.
Enjoy.
